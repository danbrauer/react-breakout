# Breakout in React

I got a teensy bit of exposure to React at my day job, and thought it'd be interesting to learn it a bit more. 

I thought I'd do this by trying to build a rudimentary version of Atari's Breakout, because once upon a time, and a very long time ago indeed, I did this in Java Swing and remember it being not so hard.

I have effectively zero web front-end experience, so this'll be interesting.

And I was tempted to title this project Breactout, but I resisted... ðŸ™„
