# Breakout in React

I got a teensy bit of exposure to React at my day job, and thought it'd be interesting to learn it a bit more. 

I thought I'd do this by trying to build a rudimentary version of Atari's Breakout, because once upon a time, and a very long time ago indeed, I did this in Java Swing and remember it being not so hard.

I have effectively zero web front-end experience, so this'll be interesting.

UPDATE: 
I found an example of a bouncy ball, and took that and added a paddle controlled by mouse movements, off of which the ball bounces. 

I suspect adding bricks and having them interact with the ball will mean refactoring and lifting state up for both ball and brick, something I ran out of time for doing.

But even just this simple exercise, plus a tutorial I did beforehand, taught me a bit about React's handling of states.
